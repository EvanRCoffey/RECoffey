				March 11th, 2018 - Moved!  Moving?

			Okay, so it hasn't been quite that long.  And I haven't been trapped inside a tiny magic lamp.  But still.  It's been a while since I've upated my blog.  10 months, in fact!  Much has happened.  Let's get started.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div>
			So, first off, the bad news - I did not find employment as a web developer.  I tried my darnedest, I realy did, but by the time we moved to Georgetown (more on that later), I had not procured a full-time position to utilize all my fancy, expensive new skills.  Unfortunately, we were not in a position to wait any longer for me to find employment, so I decided to start applying to various local non-web-developer jobs.  Luckily, I found a full-time position quickly and was able to start work immediately. </div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div>
			This may have set me back a bit in my goal of being a professional programmer, but it relieved a lot of financial pressure, and I feel blessed and thankful to have been given the opportunity.  As mentioned in my new bio, I work at a data center that services several branches of a well-known local bank, where I operate postage machinery and assist with data entry and system operations.  I have been there since late July of 2017.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
			<a href="https://peacefrogcarpetcleaning.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/main-street-square-Georgetown-Texas.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="203" src="https://peacefrogcarpetcleaning.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/main-street-square-Georgetown-Texas.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div>
			So, why the move to Georgetown?  The biggest reason was that Lesley found an opportunity to be the lead primary Montessori guide at a brand new school here.  However, we were also just tired of living in crowded, traffic-laden Austin, and since my education was finished, we were no longer tied down to that location.  Her new position made it an easy choice.  Even if I ended up having to commute back into the city, it'd be for a good reason, and at least our "home base" would be somewhere a little cozier.  Moot point, that one ended up being.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div>
			I've enjoyed my time working here, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't ready for something new.  I learned a lot about programming, and I really do feel equipped to do it professionally.  I've even picked up my music books and notation software to potentially give band directing another shot.  Which leads me to the next piece of big news: my mom, stepdad, and little sister are moving to Angola, in Africa, for 3 years.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div>
			That's right.  Africa.  To say this news came as a surprise would be an understatement.  They had vaguely mentioned big moves like this in the past, but none of them ever felt real.  In fact, several planned moves to locations much closer and more convenient all fell through, so something as far as Angola felt especially unlikely.  But, it's happening!  My stepdad has accepted a position as an engineer for Chevron working on the coast of Luanda, the capital of Angola.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<a href="https://www.un.int/angola/sites/www.un.int/files/styles/home_larg_image/public/Angola/angola-1.jpg?itok=MRcfMhdm" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="203" src="https://www.un.int/angola/sites/www.un.int/files/styles/home_larg_image/public/Angola/angola-1.jpg?itok=MRcfMhdm" width="400" /></a></div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div>
			The reason this news is connected with my wanting new opportunities is that the home they just bought together with my grandparents in Biloxi, MS, will soon be largely vacant.  Thus, to help my grandparents, save money, and start the process of moving closer to our families, we are looking into potentially moving in.  However, we can only do so if we find jobs that permit it, and we have to make a decision relatively soon, so as to not leave either of our current employers out to dry.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div>
			So, without giving too much more away, that's basically where we're at.  The goal is to get back home, but the path we'll take to get there is currently a mystery.  Perhaps someone reading could help facilitate this!  *wink*</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div>
			In the meantime, I'm gonna keep doing what I've been doing - performing well at work, improving my portfolios, staying healthy and active, and keeping an eye out for new opportunities.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			PS - I added a new page to my site to feature some stands tunes I've written for high school marching bands.  The scores are there, with MIDI recordings.  <a href="portfolio.html" class="normalLink">Check it out!</a></div>
