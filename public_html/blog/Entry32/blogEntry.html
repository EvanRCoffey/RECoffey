			Hello again from Georgetown, Texas!  The summer heat is dwindling, and the autumn breezes are starting to blow through.  I, for one, welcome this change - I'm ready to retire the shorts for a while.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div>
			Speaking of summer, it came and went without too much fanfare.  At the end of my last entry, I mentioned an upcoming 2-week adventure split between in-laws and my family.  This did, in fact, occur, and it was a lot of fun!  I got to spend some quality time with people I don't see much throughout the year, and we enjoyed time at both Disney World in Florida and a beachside condo in Alabama.  Once the trip was over, it was back to the grind for me while Lesley enjoyed the rest of her summer break and got ready for the next school year.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
			<a href="https://amp.thisisinsider.com/images/5b881e4f3cccd157008b459d-750-563.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="203" src="https://amp.thisisinsider.com/images/5b881e4f3cccd157008b459d-750-563.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div>
			I also mentioned in my last entry that I was arranging some music that I planned on shopping around to some of my band director contacts.  I ended up with a good number of tunes that I was happy with, but what I didn't realize while I was arranging was that a monster was lurking behind the corner, waiting for me.  That monster's name is Copyright Law.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div>
			How this now-glaringly-obvious hurdle did not draw itself to my attention sooner, I do not know, but once a band director friend of mine whispered "be careful" in my ear, my whole perspective changed.  I realized that selling these tunes without proper permission was, technically, against the law, and while there are lots of people that do this anyway, this is not a strategy I wanted to employ.  I decided to contact music publishers with the tunes I had arranged to see if my talents would be appreciated, and, unfortunately, I didn't hear back from any of them.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div>
			So, yeah.  Bummer.  However, this doesn't mean I've given up on arranging or writing music.  It just means this talent of mine, for now, is for demonstration purposes only, unless the music I write comes directly from my noggin or is considered public domain.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			But enough about music, let's talk about programming!  Not only did I finally finish the React Udemy course that I started last year, but I started and finished another Udemy course, that one on Git and Github.  I worked with Gihub a good bit while earning my A.S. in computer science and even more while completing the Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin, but I still felt like there were some gaps in my knowledge about this critical tool used almost ubiquitously by developers.  I'm glad I completed the course - it was much shorter than the one on React, and I feel more confident using Github now, because of it.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div>
			I have three website projects in the works - a small one, a medium one, and a large one.  I don't want to give too many details away, as I've found I work harder on my ideas if I don't talk too much about them to other people.  I'm pretty excited about all of them, though, and I hope they'll give me good practice as well as making me more attractive to employers.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>
			
			<div>
			I've been at my job here in Georgetown for over a year now, and while I don't have immediate plans to leave, I do still want to develop (ha!) my career a bit, one way or another.  If I end up utilizing my talents here, great!  If I end up going somewhere else at some point, so be it!  I guess what I'm trying to say is, even though it's been a while since I finished my last stint of education and it may seem like I'm complacent, I haven't given up on my career, whatever that career might end up looking like.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>
			
			<div>
			Lastly, I've lost 25 pounds recently, down from 200 to 175.  I've been eating a vegetarian diet for nearly 2 months, and I've made a habit of going for walks in the morning and throughout the day.  I even bought a workout bench to use with some adjustable dumbbells my stepdad donated to me.  Trying to work on my body as well as my mind!</div>

			<br /></div>

			<div>
			So, that about covers it, for now.  Still working, still searching.  Until next time!</div>
