			Hello again from Georgetown, TX!  A month or so ago, I was saying I was tired of the cold.  This week, we're supposed to hit triple digits.  Mother nature, you crazy!.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div>
			So, the anticipation put in place by March's blog entry has ended, for now - Lesley committed to another year at her school, so we'll be staying here a bit longer.  It wasn't an easy decision, but we decided to stick with our current setup, as we really do have a good thing going.  Lesley is still doing well at her job, and my office job, while easy, is comfortable and surrounds me with good people.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div>
			Really, though.  I try to mention my hard-working, talented wife here from time to time, but today she gets her own paragraph.  Since she decided to be a Montessori guide about 8 years ago, she has started three different classrooms from scratch, has received tons of requests from parents for their children to be in her room, and has held leadership positions at her current and most recent schools.  She wants to open her own school one day, and I believe the work she has done and is doing proves that she's worthy of that honor.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
			<a href="http://www.mariamontessori.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC_3160-large.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="203" src="http://www.mariamontessori.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC_3160-large.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div>
			So, what have I been up to, you ask?  Well, after deciding that I wanted to look for both programming and band director jobs, I did an inventory of my musical talents and decided that I should focus on something I was somewhat good at in college: arranging music for marching band.  Since then, I've arranged 4 new songs (including "Finesse" by Bruno Mars and Cardi B - hence the gif) and collected 5 others from my past, and I put them all on the *Tunes* page of this website.  I'm going to try to get some recordings from my band director friends and eventually monetize my abilities in some way.  At the very least, building my portfolio can only improve my chances of getting hired to teach.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div>
			Luckily, I've amassed what I feel is an adequate number of tunes to showcase my talents, so I plan to as soon as possible dive back into programming.  I've got two simple projects in the works, then I'm hoping to do some networking to find opportunities to code with or for others, even if it's for free.  I think it'd be better to team up with someone than to make yet another independent project likely to be limited in scope.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>

			<div>
			The school year is almost over for Lesley, and when it's done, we'll be going on a little vacation!  This will be my first real vacation since starting my job back in July of last year, so I'm excited.  We're going to Disney World with Lesley's family, then we're hanging out in Mississippi and Alabama with my family.  Hopefully, it'll be a lot of fun.</div>
